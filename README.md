  #1. Forecasting MidTerm Take Home Test  Data Published: 2015 
  
The word document "Midterm Take Home" were my answers to a Midterm test from Graduate School. I also added my source code "Midterm Take Home Test.SAS" I used for the answers. Since graduating from Grad School, I have returned back and updated the word document and SAS program to eleborate upon the explanation in my midterm test. I did really well on my midterm test, but I found the problems to be a rich source of learning even after graduating school.
